# self-assembly
Self-assembly experiments written in C and CUDA based on the Harvard experiment, "The Free Energy Landscape of Clusters of Attractive Hard Spheres"

* Simulated non-deterministic environment to allow particles to form structures
* Applications include self-assembled microchips and improved drug delivery systems
* Took advantage of GPU processing to run millions of experiments in parallel
